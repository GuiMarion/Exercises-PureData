# Exercises-PureData

Here you can find some pd externals coded in C for a class validation at IRCAM, ATIAM master's degree dipensed by Mr. Philippe Esling.

## Getting Started

We splitted the exercices in two parts : Tools and Instrument, each corresponding folder has a proper Makefile.

Some mandatory files are in other gits (puredata and pd-lib-builder) so if you want to use our Makefile, please git clone the corresponding gits. So to get started, go to a directory you want to have our projet into and do the following : 

      git clone https://github.com/GuiMarion/Exercises-PureData.git
      
 
      cd Exercises-PureData
      
 
      git clone https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data
     
 
      git clone https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder.git
      
Now, you have everything you need to compile our externals, just make sure you have pd installed. Note that for some reasons our externals doesn't work with pd vanilla on MacOs, so if you want to use them on your mac please use pd-extended.
