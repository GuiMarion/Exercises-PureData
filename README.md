# Exercises-PureData

Here you can find some pd externals coded in C for a class validation at IRCAM ATIAM master's degree dipensed by Mr. Philippe Esling.

## Getting Started

We splitted the exercices in two parts : Tools and Instruments. Each corresponding folder has a proper Makefile, all mandatory files are in other gits (puredata and pd-lib-builder)
so if you want to use our Makefile, please git clone the corresponding git. So to get started, go to a directory you want to have our projet in and do the following : 

      git clone https://github.com/GuiMarion/Exercises-PureData.git
      
      cd Exercises-PureData
      
      git clone https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data
      
      git clone https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder.git
      
Now, you have everythin you need to compile our externals, make sure you have pd installed. Note that for some reasons our externals doesn't work with pd vanilla on macOs, so if you want to use them on your make, please use pd-extended.
